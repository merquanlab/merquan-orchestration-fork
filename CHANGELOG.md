# Changelog

## Unreleased — post-v1.0.0-rc1 (2026-05-09 → present)

Wave 1 (shadow-mode read cutover) + Wave 5 P0/P1 (smart-context smart injection) shipped on top of the v1.0.0-rc1 architectural baseline.

### Added — Wave 4.6 provider dispatch generalization

- **PR-4.6.1** `scripts/lib/provider_dispatch.py` — provider-agnostic dispatch entry-point (`--provider {claude,codex,gemini,litellm:<model>}`). Claude path delegates byte-identically to `subprocess_dispatch.deliver_with_recovery`; codex/gemini/litellm stubs exit 64 (EX_USAGE) with PR reference until spawn handlers land in PR-4.6.3/4.6.4/4.6.5. All existing `subprocess_dispatch.py` flags forwarded verbatim. No Anthropic SDK imported. See `claudedocs/wave4.6-provider-dispatch-generalization-design-2026-05-13.md §PR-4.6.1`.

### Added — Wave 1 shadow-mode read cutover (#450–#454)
- **PR-W1.1 (#450)** `scripts/lib/shadow_verifier.py` — independent comparator (no shared code with the migration) computing 6 zero-tolerance divergence metrics: wrong-project rows, scoping/blocking-finding mismatch, IntelligenceSelector top-3 divergence, count drift (0%) + checksum drift (<0.01%), lease-key collision count, p95-latency ratio (central ≤ 1.5× per-project).
- **PR-W1.2 (#451)** `scripts/lib/shadow_logger.py` NDJSON writer + `scripts/shadow_report.py` CLI + `scripts/rotate_shadow_ledger.sh` timestamp-suffix rotation under flock; routes via `vnx_paths.resolve_paths()` (no `.vnx-data/state/` literals).
- **PR-W1.3 (#452)** T0 state-builder shadow wiring — 4 read sites in `scripts/build_t0_state.py` instrumented with `VNX_USE_CENTRAL_DB=unset|shadow|1` flag.
- **PR-W1.4 (#453)** `IntelligenceSelector` (5 read methods) + `DispatchRegister` shadow wiring (~600 LOC additions).
- **PR-W1.5 (#454)** Dashboard read paths shadow-wired (`api_intelligence.py`, `api_operator.py`); canary divergence test pack with 14+ deliberate-divergence fixtures (`tests/canary/test_shadow_canary_divergence.py`); operator-readable `docs/operations/wave1-rollback.md`.

### Added — Wave 5 smart-context injection (#455–#456)
- **PR-W5.0 (#455)** `scripts/lib/prior_round_injector.py` — when a dispatch has `pr_id` mapping to existing review-gate results, fetch blocking + advisory findings from prior rounds and inject as a bounded markdown section (≤2000 chars). Scope-filtered by `dispatch_paths` overlap; recency-sorted; LRU-cached 60s TTL; anti-anchoring instruction included per Codex Q4 epistemic-failure-mode mitigation. Validated against PR #432's 9-round cascade as canonical proof-of-concept.
- **PR-W5.1 (#456)** `scripts/lib/adr_indexer.py` — scans `docs/governance/decisions/ADR-*.md` for file-path references, builds an inverted index `file_path → [ADR_ids]`. When dispatch `dispatch_paths` overlap with ADR-referenced files, the relevant ADR sections are auto-injected as governance context. Bounded by 1500-char budget; mtime-based 60s TTL cache.

### Added — Governance amendment
- **ADR-011 v2 (#449)** — split subagent pilot into 2 sequential gates: Gate 1 provenance/redaction (10 dispatches), Gate 2 performance baseline (15 dispatches, median ≥30% wall-clock saved + p25 ≥0%).

### Documentation produced (claudedocs/, gitignored)
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-wave1-design.md` — Wave 1 spec with 6 hard metrics
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-wave5-p0-design.md` — prior-round-findings injection design
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-vnx-smart-context-design.md` — three-state context bundle pipeline
- `claudedocs/2026-05-10-deepseek-v4-pro-harness-feasibility.md` — three integration paths analysis
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-vnx-codex-strategic-review.md` + `2026-05-09-vnx-gemini-strategic-review.md` + `2026-05-09-vnx-reviews-synthesis.md` — dual-LLM external review insights driving v1.2 strategic plan

### Burn-in pending (not yet merged into v1.0.0 final)
- Wave 1 cutover requires 7 consecutive days clean on all 6 hard metrics (per project, per table) before flipping `VNX_USE_CENTRAL_DB=shadow → 1`.
- Wave 5 P2/P3/P4 (file:line code anchors / operator memory / schema introspection) extend the +30pp smart-context lift; in flight.
- v1.0.0 final tag is operator-decision after Wave 1 cutover validates on pilot projects.

## v1.0.0-rc1 — 2026-05-09 (Architectural stabilization milestone)

Chain summary: Wave 0 + Wave 0.5 of the strategic replan — architectural decisions LOCKED via 14 ADRs, central VNX state proven on real production data (855k snippets across 4 projects, 0 verifier discrepancies), CI gate enforcing OAuth-only Claude routing, smart context injection validated at +30 percentage-point dispatch quality lift on 658 outcome-tagged dispatches.

This is the architectural stabilization moment: dispatch envelope, receipt schema, NDJSON ledger format, and ADR-locked invariants are now backwards-compatibility-honoring. Future v1.x is feature additions on a stable foundation; future v2.0 reserved for breaking changes.

### Added — ADR backfill (10 new ADRs, 003-014)
- ADR-003 — OAuth-only Claude routing via `claude -p` subprocess (no SDK, no API key) (#439)
- ADR-004 — VNX positioning: self-hosted alternative to Anthropic Managed Agents (#439)
- ADR-005 — Append-only NDJSON audit ledger as primary orchestration substrate (#439)
- ADR-006 — Mandatory staging→promote with human approval gate (#439)
- ADR-007 — Multi-tenant `project_id` stamping with composite UNIQUE rebuilds (#439)
- ADR-008 — Dual-LLM adversarial review (codex_gate + gemini_review) with `contract_hash` evidence binding (#439)
- ADR-009 — Schema-first migrations via PRAGMA introspection (no hardcoded column projections) (#439)
- ADR-010 — Subprocess adapter (`claude -p`) as canonical Claude routing (#439)
- ADR-011 — Manager+worker hierarchy with explicit depth>1; subagents Conditional/Pilot for read-only parallel-fanout (#439, #447)
- ADR-012 — Hybrid interactive+headless (no retire-interactive) (#439)
- ADR-013 — Worker pool size as configuration, not constant (workers = N) (#445)
- ADR-014 — Autonomous mode = pre-approved chain dispatch with SHA-256 chain-spec hash as consent token (#445)

### Added — Structural enforcement
- CI gate `ADR-003: No Anthropic SDK Imports` — blocks any `import anthropic` / `from anthropic` / `import claude_agent_sdk` in `scripts/`, `dashboard/`, `tests/`. Magic-comment opt-in for explicit exceptions only. (#439)
- `scripts/check_adr_003_no_sdk_imports.py` + `tests/test_adr_003_no_sdk_imports.py` (23 unit tests).

### Improved — Migration architecture (Phase 6 P4)
- One-shot data import script `scripts/migrate_to_central_vnx.py` (#432): real-data success on 4 production source DBs (855k code_snippets, 505 dispatches, 0 verifier discrepancies)
- Migration 0016 schema-first rewrite per ADR-009 (#446): replaces hardcoded 12-column projection with PRAGMA introspection; orphan project_id stamping uses migrating-project_id (not vnx-dev fallback); `_import_table` streams via `cursor.fetchmany(500)` instead of materializing full table — resolves OI-1375, OI-1376, OI-1377.
- Composite UNIQUE rebuilds for 5 round-6 tables (`session_analytics`, `vnx_code_quality`, `dispatch_quality_context`, `dispatch_metadata`, `dispatch_experiments`)
- Schema audit step `_audit_unique_constraints()` catches T3 single-column UNIQUE patterns at startup
- Structural test parsing `0015_complete_project_id.sql` enforces ALTER↔IMPORT_TABLES symmetry (would have caught all round-7/8/9 gaps)
- Dispatch-register identity fallback per-field (was all-or-nothing); dual-writer locking on data file (was sentinel only); ghost-gate receipt rerouting fixed (#446 sibling)

### Added — Repo hygiene (OI-1373 cleanup)
- Tier 1: 8 business agent drafts moved from public `roadmap/features/phase-16-business-domain-bootstrap/agent_drafts/` to private `claudedocs/business-domain/` (#440)
- Tier 2: 7 strategy files (`KICKOFF.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `backlog.yaml`, `roadmap.yaml`, 3 dispatch_plans) from `.vnx-data/strategy/` to `claudedocs/strategy/`; `!.vnx-data/strategy/` carve-out removed from `.gitignore` (#441)
- Tier 3: `.vnx-data/state/PROJECT_STATE_DESIGN.md` to private; 2 `.vnx-data/state/` carve-outs removed (in #443)
- Tier 4: 18 phase FEATURE_PLAN.md files from public `roadmap/features/<phase>/` to `claudedocs/roadmap/features/` (#442)
- Tier 5: 9 stale docs from `docs/internal/plans/` and `docs/research/` archived to `claudedocs/archive/{headless-t0-research,research-2026-spring}/` (#443)
- Pattern: filesystem `mv` + `git add -u` (NOT `git mv`) — preserves files locally on disk while removing from git tracking. History scrub intentionally NOT performed.

### Added — Strategic documentation
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-vnx-strategic-replan-proposal.md` v1.1 — 6-wave plan (Wave 0-6) replacing the overtaken-by-reality PRD-UH-001 v1.3 framing
- `claudedocs/PRD-VNX-UH-002-v1.0-DRAFT.md` — "VNX 2.0: self-hosted alternative to Anthropic Managed Agents" with 8 structural moats, ICP refinement, and §11.b open horizons

- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-vnx-market-validation.md` — verdict CONDITIONAL GO; OpenClaw ban (April 2026) retroactively validated M6/ADR-003 OAuth-only as structural ToS-policy moat
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-vnx-smart-context-design.md` — three-state intelligence pipeline design + +30pp lift PoC
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-vnx-subagent-tactical-research.md` — verdict Conditional/Pilot; T1-only `VNX_T1_TACTICAL_SUBAGENTS=1`, read-only parallel-fanout, 4-week pilot
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-vnx-f46-f58-reconciliation.md` — F46-F58 phantom-features claim refuted: 6 real-clean-PR + 6 cluster-titled + 1 verify + 0 phantom
- `claudedocs/2026-05-09-p4-migration-architecture-lessons.md` — bug taxonomy + 14 action items from the 9-round PR #432 chain
- `claudedocs/blog-drafts/2026-05-09-intelligence-30pp-lift-DRAFT.md` — 2300-word public-facing deep-dive draft on the +30pp result
- PRD-UH-001 v1.3 archived to `claudedocs/archive/`

### Validated — Smart context injection (gevalideerd op real production data)
- `IntelligenceSelector.select()` pipeline measured: **88.9% dispatch success WITH intelligence vs 58.3% WITHOUT** across 658 outcome-tagged dispatches (+30.6 pp lift)
- 922 rows in `intelligence_injections` ledger growing hourly
- Pipeline plumbing 9/10; content quality 2/10 — "the lift we got despite injecting governance noise; imagine signal" (Wave 5 design target)

### Open items resolved
- OI-1373 (49+ strategic/business docs in public repo) — fully closed via Tiers 1-5
- OI-1375 (migration 0016 hardcoded 12-column projection) — closed by #446
- OI-1376 (migration 0016 orphan COALESCE project_id fallback) — closed by #446
- OI-1377 (`_import_table` materializes full source table) — closed by #446

### Known open items deferred to v1.0.0 final
- OI-1374 (dashboard `/agent-stream` SSE lifecycle regression — separate-PR cleanup)

### Added — Wave 4 OTel observability foundation (#468)
- **PR-W4.1 (#468)** — opt-in OpenTelemetry export wired into subprocess_dispatch completion. Emits `dispatch_completion_count` metric + spans. Env-gated via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`; no-op when unset.

### Added — Wave 2 package extraction foundation (#469, #478)
- **PR-W2.0a (#469)** package skeleton with `pyproject.toml` + `vnx_core` + `vnx_cli` + smoke tests + `docs/operations/PACKAGE_BUILD.md`
- **PR-W2.1a-redo (#478)** First module migration: `function_size_gate.py` → `vnx_core`, with `sys.path`-fallback shim in `scripts/lib/`. Demonstrates migration pattern for non-`__file__`-dependent modules.

### Added — Wave 4.5 provider parity (#471, #472, #477, #479)
- **PR-W4.5.1 (#471)** `PromptAssembler` provider-agnostic methods (`for_claude_subprocess`, `for_codex_subprocess`, `for_gemini_subprocess`, `for_litellm_provider`). Existing claude path byte-identical.
- **PR-W4.5.2 (#472)** Codex + Gemini adapters use `PromptAssembler`. `AGENTS.md` + `GEMINI.md` tri-file activated by `vnx init` bootstrap.
- **PR-W4.5.2b (#479)** Gate reviewer prompts use `gh pr diff` authoritative source. New `scripts/lib/prompts/roles/reviewer.md`. `PromptAssembler` skips L1 `base_worker` for reviewer role.
- **PR-W4.5.3 (#477)** Intelligence injection per-provider with empty-`dispatch_id` guard (audit-safe).

### Fixed — Security + governance
- **OI-1369 (#465)** Path traversal in `vnx_paths.resolve_central_data_dir` — strict regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,31}$`
- **OI-1294 (#467)** `compact_open_items_digest` function-size 76→34 via mechanical `_coid_` helper extraction
- **OI-1415 (#462)** `review_contract.content_hash` backward-compat (omit empty `deleted_files`)

### Added — Infrastructure
- **PR (#464)** T0 canonical `subprocess_dispatch.py` routing rule in templates + skill
- **PR (#463)** Default `VNX_QUEUE_POPUP_ENABLED=0` in init-time preset templates
- **PR (#480)** Vertex routing alternative for gemini quota workaround (`docs/operations/GEMINI_VERTEX_ROUTING.md`)

### Plumbing
- **PR (#462)** CFX-W5-2 — `pr_id` propagation + headless daemon entry points + `IndexCache` + net-deletion gate + `deleted_files` plumbing for Wave 5 smart-context

### Deferred (with OIs for follow-up)
- PR #466 OI-1370 race fix — needs systemic locking refactor across all writer paths
- PR #470 Wave 2 Phase 1a `vnx_paths` — uses `__file__`, blocked until decoupled
- PR #473 Wave 4.5 PR-2b superseded by #479
- PR #474 Wave 4.5 PR-3 superseded by #477
- PR #475 OI-1370 redo attempt — defer to systemic refactor

### Fixed — OI-1370 systemic locking refactor (#482, #483, #484, #485, #486)

The original `migrate_phase3_envelope` race (writer pre-rename appends to unlinked inode) required a system-wide locking refactor across all writer paths to envelope/state files. Three earlier scoped-fix attempts (PR #466, #475 round-2) were blocked by codex because each ad-hoc lock left other writers uncoordinated.

- **PR #482** — OPUS architect plan in `claudedocs/oi1370-systemic-locking-refactor-plan-2026-05-13.md`. 4-PR phasing + Option-A sentinel-per-file recommendation.
- **PR N1 (#483)** — `scripts/lib/state_writer.append_locked()` helper with sentinel registry. 100-thread × 100-write concurrency test passes.
- **PR N2 (#484)** — migrate `scripts/lib/gate_register_emit.py` + `scripts/lib/cleanup_worker_exit.py` to helper.
- **PR N3 (#485)** — migrate `scripts/compact_state.compact_receipts` + `scripts/backfill_headless_receipts._update_ndjson`.
- **PR N4 (#486)** — final: migrate `scripts/migrate_phase3_envelope.py` + `scripts/lib/dispatch_register._write_event_locked`. Race eliminated by construction.

All four implementation PRs (#483-486) implemented by **Codex CLI workers** (first production codex-worker dispatches in this codebase). Each PR codex_gate clean (0 blocking, max 1 advisory). OI-1370 closed.

## Unreleased

### Features
- **F59-PR1 event-archive-analyzer**: `scripts/lib/event_analyzer.py` — deterministic behavioral analysis of dispatch NDJSON event archives; extracts tool counts (Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Grep/Glob), exploration depth (`reads_before_first_write`), rework indicators (`edit_cycles_same_file`, `test_fail_edit_cycles`), phase sequences (explore→implement→test→commit), bash error extraction, pytest result parsing, and commit/push/report detection; CLI supports `--dispatch`, `--all`, `--summary`, and `--output` modes; 22 tests in `tests/test_event_analyzer.py` covering real archive fixtures and synthetic NDJSON scenarios

### Dashboard
- **dispatch-viewer**: Add `/operator/dispatches` list view with stage tabs (staging/pending/active/review/done), track/terminal/search filters, and per-row receipt status indicator. Add `/operator/dispatches/[id]` detail page with Overview/Event Replay/Instruction/Result tabs; replay tab renders phase-colored tool-use timeline from archived NDJSON with scrubbable cursor, play/pause/step controls, and phase filter chips. Data flows through existing `/api/dispatches*` endpoints (F59-PR4).

### Docs
- **docs-audit-cleanup-round-2**: Fix 12 incorrect/stale findings from audit slices B+C: correct `VNX_CANONICAL_LEASE_ACTIVE` default in `RUNTIME_CORE_ROLLBACK.md`; fix function name and default-adapter description in `SUBPROCESS_ADAPTER_FEATURE_FLAG.md`; fix self-referential broken stub in `MULTI_MODEL_GUIDE.md`; add deprecation notice to `RECEIPT_PROCESSING_FLOW.md`; update stale paths in `RECEIPT_PIPELINE.md`; mark unimplemented scripts in `AUTONOMOUS_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md`; fix `MONITORING_GUIDE.md` reference in `docs/operations/README.md`; correct Opus 4.6/4.5 pricing in `COST_TRACKING_GUIDE.md`; rewrite `EXIT_CODES.md` around named failure classes; fix env-override list in `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`; update `dashboard/README.md` for token-dashboard subdir + port 3100 + correct API/frontend status; fix `scripts/_archive/` non-existence in `SCRIPTS_INDEX.md`.
- **docs-audit-cleanup**: Fix broken link to archived `MONITORING_GUIDE.md` in `docs/README.md`; correct inaccurate "Internal (not in repo)" claim in `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md` to list the 4 tracked headless-T0 research docs; remove 5 dead markdown hyperlinks in `docs/operations/AUTONOMOUS_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` pointing to private planning docs not in repo.
- **event-streams**: Add `docs/operations/EVENT_STREAMS.md` documenting the per-dispatch ring-buffer lifecycle of `.vnx-data/events/T{n}.ndjson` and the `events/archive/{terminal}/{dispatch_id}.ndjson` layout; linked from `docs/operations/README.md` and `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`. Clarifies a misinterpretation flagged as W-2 in the 2026-04-23 audit-trail investigation (OI-AT-6a).

### Fixes
- **W5A-cleanups**: Remove stale `(missing source)` claim from `event-streams` CHANGELOG entry; `ghost-receipt-filter` entry annotated with source-confirmed note (OI-1133). Rename `GovernanceProfile` enum in `governance_profile_selector.py` to `GovernanceProfileEnum` to eliminate naming conflict with `GovernanceProfile` dataclass in `governance_profiles.py`; all importers updated (OI-1160). Upgrade `HeadlessOrchestrator._check_all_gates_passed()` to use `gate_status.is_pass()` — now enforces `blocking_findings` and `blocking_count` checks in addition to status (OI-1139).
- **dashboard-duplicate-key**: Fix duplicate-key React error on `/operator/dispatches` — `_scan_dispatches` was mapping both `completed/` and `rejected/` directories to stage `done`, causing the same dispatch ID to appear twice when a dispatch existed in both directories (regression from F59-PR4 #266). Backend fix: `rejected/` now maps to a distinct `rejected` stage; priority-based dedup (`staging > pending > active > review > done > rejected`) ensures exactly one canonical entry per dispatch_id. Frontend fix: `DispatchList` now uses composite key `${id}-${stage}` as belt-and-suspenders defense. `DispatchStage` type and stage badge updated to include `rejected`; dispatches page includes `rejected` in stage tabs.
- **learning-loop-phases**: Fix nightly pipeline Phase 3 (`3-session-dispatch-link`) and Phase 4 (`4-learning-cycle`) to unblock the learning loop; add `report_findings` table migration to `quality_db_init.py` (OI-1154); fix `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` in `learning_loop.py::archive_unused_patterns` by introducing `_to_aware_utc()` helper and normalizing all datetime comparisons to UTC-aware throughout `LearningLoop`; 20 new tests in `tests/test_learning_loop_tz.py` and `tests/test_report_findings_schema.py` (OI-1155)
- **restore-daemon-deps**: Restore 44 daemon dependency files deleted in cleanup PR #205; includes direct `intelligence_daemon.py` imports (`pr_discovery`, `intelligence_dashboard`, `intelligence_hygiene`, `retrospective_digest`, `retrospective_model_hook`), daemon infrastructure (`runtime_supervisor`, `supervisor_shadow`, `worker_state_manager`, `workflow_incident_handler`, `workflow_supervisor`, `headless_transport_adapter`), daemon scripts (`heartbeat_ack_monitor_daemon`, `intelligence_daemon_monitor`, `session_gc`, `subprocess_health_monitor`), and supporting lib modules; fix `terminal_state_check.py` regression restoring `check_terminal()` function; install `watchdog` package dependency; 576 passing tests
- **restore-python-singleton**: Restore `scripts/lib/python_singleton.py` — deleted by cleanup commit cb17479; re-adds `enforce_python_singleton()` with original signature `(name, locks_dir, pids_dir, log=None)`; unblocks `intelligence_daemon`, `unified_state_manager_v2`, and `heartbeat_ack_monitor` which all hard-exit on import failure
- **event-streams-doc**: Remove broken `.vnx-data/unified_reports/...` link from `docs/operations/EVENT_STREAMS.md` historical-context paragraph; `.vnx-data/` is gitignored runtime state and never resolves from committed docs (OI-1141).
- **gate-status-check**: `_check_all_gates_passed()` now loads each required gate result JSON and verifies `status` is in `{"completed", "pass"}` before emitting `feature_gates_complete`; a `"failed"` result file no longer unblocks features (OI-1139). `cleanup_orphan_gates.main()` tracks resolved orphans individually instead of using a count-based slice, so non-prefix write failures log the correct set to `governance_audit.ndjson` (OI-1140). 7 new tests in `tests/test_gate_status_check.py`.
- **governance-audit-stamping**: All `governance_audit.ndjson` writers now stamp `dispatch_id` and `pr_number` on every row; `log_gate_result()` gains `dispatch_id` param; `log_dispatch_decision()` gains `pr_number` param; `cleanup_orphan_gates` extracts pr_number from stem and dispatch_id from request_data; `auto_gate_trigger` forwards dispatch_id to gate log; headless daemon returns pr_number from pre-check for dispatch_decision rows; 10 new tests in `tests/test_governance_audit_stamping.py` (OI-AT-5)
- **headless-receipts-backfill**: Backfill script `scripts/backfill_headless_receipts.py` retroactively patches all 363 processed receipts and 275 ndjson entries that carried `dispatch_id="unknown"` prior to OI-AT-4 phase 1; idempotent; 34 tests in `tests/test_backfill_headless_receipts.py`
- **headless-reports-layout**: Gate reports now written to `unified_reports/headless/` subdir; `VNX_HEADLESS_REPORTS_DIR` added to `vnx_paths.py` and `vnx_paths.sh`; receipt processor scans both dirs; 11 new tests (OI-AT-7)
- **ci-slug-match-gate**: `scripts/check_ci_slug_match.py` — CI gate validates Dispatch-ID present in commit bodies and slug portion matches branch name; shadow mode by default (`VNX_SLUG_ENFORCEMENT=1` to block); new `slug-match-check` job added to `vnx-ci.yml`; 57 tests in `tests/test_ci_slug_match_gate.py`
- **headless-gate-dispatch-id**: Gate request handlers now accept and persist `dispatch_id` in request payloads; `materialize_artifacts` emits real dispatch_id in result JSON and sidecar instead of synthetic `gate-<gate>-pr-<n>` strings; `review_gate_manager` CLI gains `--dispatch-id` arg; 12 new tests (OI-AT-4)
- **audit-hook-active-drain**: Install `prepare-commit-msg` hook via `core.hooksPath=hooks/git`; add `scripts/check_active_drain.py` janitor that moves receipted dispatches from `active/` to `completed/` and orphans older than threshold to `dead_letter/`; 23 passing tests
- **ghost-receipt-filter**: Route headless gate receipts with `dispatch_id="unknown"` to a separate `gate_events.ndjson` stream instead of polluting `t0_receipts.ndjson`; adds `headless_review_receipt` schema module (`scripts/lib/headless_review_receipt.py`) with 30 passing tests; source confirmed in-tree (OI-1133)
- **dispatcher**: Skip tmux MODE_CONTROL pre-flight (pane probe, configure_terminal_mode, C-u clear, sleep) for subprocess-routed terminals; call only mode_pre_check to set _CTM_* globals needed by deliver_dispatch_to_terminal
- **Latency PR-1+PR2 CI fix**: Update `tests/test_subprocess_dispatch.py` stale assertions from old defaults (chunk_timeout=120, total_deadline=600) to new defaults (chunk_timeout=300, total_deadline=900) introduced by latency PR-1
- **Latency PR-2**: Add `SessionStore` (`scripts/lib/session_store.py`) — atomic JSON file-backed store that persists Claude session IDs per terminal; wire into `deliver_via_subprocess()` to pass `--resume <session_id>` on subsequent dispatches (opt-in via `VNX_SESSION_RESUME=1`)
- **Latency PR-1**: Add 60s cooldown for invalid-skill dispatches in `dispatcher_v8_minimal.sh` (env-tunable via `VNX_INVALID_SKILL_COOLDOWN`) to prevent log floods and queue stalls on every 2s poll
- **Latency PR-1**: Raise `chunk_timeout` default from 120s → 300s and `total_deadline` from 600s → 900s in `subprocess_adapter.py` and `subprocess_dispatch.py`; both tuneable via `VNX_CHUNK_TIMEOUT` / `VNX_TOTAL_DEADLINE` env vars
- **W0 cleanup**: `scripts/review_gate_manager.py` — auto-compute `changed_files` from git diff when `--changed-files` is empty and `--branch` is provided (eliminates context contamination); `scripts/lib/dispatch_instruction_validator.py` — D-8 rule bumped from `warn` to `blocker` for gate-bearing dispatches; 4 new tests

### Bug Fixes

- **W0 PR-2 fix**: `receipt_processor_v4.sh` — fix shell quoting in `_auto_release_lease_on_receipt` (array-based args replace unquoted `${:+}` expansion) and fix conflicting state on `task_timeout+no_confirmation` (skip auto-release when shadow intentionally keeps terminal blocked); 8 new tests (22 total)

### Features

- **W0 PR-2**: Auto-lease-release on task receipt — `receipt_processor_v4.sh` now calls `release-on-receipt` automatically on `task_complete`/`task_failed`/`task_timeout` events, eliminating the need for manual `release-on-failure` after every worker receipt; `RuntimeCore.release_on_receipt()` resolves generation internally with dispatch-id ownership guard and idempotent idle-terminal handling

### Security
- **W0 PR-4 security fix**: `vnx_snapshot.py` — path traversal (Zip Slip) + symlink hardening: `do_restore` now uses `tarfile.extractall(filter="data")` (Python 3.12 safe extraction, raises on path-traversal/absolute-symlink members) instead of the previous unsafe `extractall` with suppressed warnings; `do_snapshot` now filters out absolute symlinks and relative symlinks that escape `.vnx-data/` before they enter the archive; 5 new security tests (17 total)

### Fixes
- **W0 PR-5 fix2**: `scripts/lib/log_artifact.py` — path traversal hardening: `_safe_filename()` strips path separators and collapses `..` sequences from `run_id` before using it in artifact filenames; `scripts/lib/headless_inspect.py` — `list_runs()` `show_all` parameter was dead code (never branched on); added explicit `elif show_all:` branch; 3 new tests (53 total)
- **W0 PR-5 fix**: `.github/workflows/burn-in-headless.yml` — remove `skip_billing_gate` input and its conditional job guard (billing safety now unconditional); fix unexpanded `$VNX_HOME` in single-quoted heredoc by using `os.environ.get("VNX_HOME")` in Python instead of shell expansion
- **F32-R3**: `deliver_via_subprocess` now fail-closes on non-zero subprocess exit code — `adapter.observe()` is checked after events are drained; non-zero returncode returns `success=False` regardless of parsed event count; fixes broken test assertions in `test_subprocess_dispatch.py` and `test_subprocess_dispatch_integration.py` (`result is True/False` → `result.success is True/False`)
- **F36-R8 PR-234**: Fix cross-platform `stat` portability in `check_flood_protection()` (GNU/Linux compatibility); defer SHA fallback warning until after `log()` is defined; manual mode now honors last-processed watermark in `should_process_report()`

### Features
- **W0 PR-6**: `scripts/lib/dispatch_instruction_validator.py` — dispatch instruction template validator (D-1..D-8): Dispatch-ID format, description presence, scope item count thresholds (warn ≥9/block ≥16), unbounded-task language detection, gate/quality-gate alignment, file directory breadth, instruction size, and success-criteria presence; 35 tests in `tests/test_dispatch_instruction_validator.py`
- **W0 PR-5**: `.github/workflows/burn-in-headless.yml` — scheduled weekly burn-in CI (Sunday 02:00 UTC) running billing-safety gate (BS-1..BS-6) followed by burn-in certification (B-1..B-10), snapshot tooling regression, and fixture smoke checks; `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs; zero API cost (CLI stub via `VNX_HEADLESS_CLI=echo`)
- **W0 PR-5**: `scripts/lib/exit_classifier.py` — maps subprocess exit conditions to named failure classes (`SUCCESS/TIMEOUT/TOOL_FAIL/INFRA_FAIL/NO_OUTPUT/INTERRUPTED/PROMPT_ERR/UNKNOWN`) with retryability, signal extraction, and operator hints
- **W0 PR-5**: `scripts/lib/log_artifact.py` — structured human-readable run-log writer (`<run_id>.log`) and raw output capture (`<run_id>.out`) for operator inspection without file spelunking
- **W0 PR-5**: `scripts/lib/headless_inspect.py` — operator inspection tools: `format_run_line`, `format_run_detail`, `list_runs`, `build_health_summary`, `format_health_summary`
- **W0 PR-5**: `tests/conftest.py` — shared pytest fixtures (`vnx_state_dir`, `vnx_registry`, `vnx_artifact_dir`, `vnx_dispatch_dir`, `vnx_fake_project`, `vnx_snapshot_dir`) for burn-in and snapshot test suites; `make_vnx_dispatch_bundle` factory fixture
- **W0 PR-5**: `tests/fixtures/dispatch_bundle_research.json` + `dispatch_bundle_analysis.json` — CI fixture bundles for headless adapter integration tests
- **W0 PR-5**: `tests/test_billing_safety.py` — 12 billing-safety assertions across BS-1..BS-6: no SDK imports, no direct API URLs, no hardcoded keys, no key assignments, CLI-only subprocess, clean fixture files
- **W0 PR-4**: `vnx snapshot/restore/quiesce-check` — CLI tools for project-state backup and migration readiness: tarball + SQL dump of `.vnx-data/`, fail-safe restore with overwrite guard, and read-only quiesce verification across 4 conditions (active dispatches, held leases, in-flight gates, uncommitted changes)
- **W0 PR-1**: `scripts/dispatcher_supervisor.sh` — dedicated auto-restart supervisor for `dispatcher_v8_minimal.sh` with exponential backoff (2s→60s), stale singleton lock cleanup before each restart, SIGTERM-safe child shutdown, and `status` subcommand
- **F32 Wave D PR-1**: T2/T3 default subprocess delivery — `deliver_dispatch_to_terminal` now defaults T1/T2/T3 to subprocess adapter; T0 remains tmux by default; `VNX_ADAPTER_Tx=tmux` opts any terminal back to tmux
- **F36 PR-1**: T0 decision summarizer (`t0_decision_summarizer.py`) — haiku-powered structured decision log writer with file-locking JSONL append, log rotation, and assembler query interface
- **F36 PR-1b**: T0 decision log passive writer (`t0_decision_log.py`) — zero-LLM path converting decision_executor events to JSONL records with cursor tracking for idempotent incremental replay
- **F36 PR-233 fix**: `_rotate_if_needed` holds exclusive lock across full copy+truncate to prevent concurrent-writer data loss; `process_events_file` resets stale cursor when it exceeds file length after source reset
- **F36 PR-233 re-gate fix**: inode-based cursor invalidation in `process_events_file` detects source-file replacement (same or greater line count) and resets cursor to 0; `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock` untracked and added to `.gitignore`
- **F36 PR-233 final fix**: parse-before-advance in `process_events_file` — partial trailing JSON line does not advance cursor (retried next invocation); malformed non-last lines log warning and advance as before
- **F36 PR-233 round-4 fix**: legacy cursor upgrade in `process_events_file` — cursor written without inode (legacy `save_cursor` format) is upgraded with current inode even when no new events exist, enabling same-length file replacement detection on all subsequent runs
- **F36 Wave B PR-2**: T0 escalations log (`t0_escalations_log.py`) — passive JSONL writer for escalation records with dual adapter hooks: `decision_executor._handle_escalate()` emits executor-source records; `governance_escalation.transition_escalation()` emits governance-source records with full entity/trigger data; batch-replay CLI with inode-based cursor tracking
- **F36 Wave B PR-1**: `VNX_ADAPTER_T0=subprocess` cutover flag — `is_headless_t0()` added to receipt processor; T0 snapshot annotated with `adapter/headless` fields when headless; `dispatch_deliver.sh` documents explicit T0 subprocess support; `heartbeat_ack_monitor` docstring updated for T0 coverage
- **F36 Wave C PR-1**: Shadow mode decision parity harness (`shadow_mode_runner.py`) — runs the headless T0 decision engine in dry-run mode against recent trigger events, compares shadow decisions to the actual decision log, and generates JSONL + markdown parity reports under `{VNX_DATA_DIR}/shadow_parity/`; 64 tests covering all public functions
- **F36 Wave C PR-239 fix**: Shadow runner pairing correctness — replaced positional event↔decision alignment with `dispatch_id`-keyed lookup (FIFO fallback for non-dispatch events); prevents stale pairings when cursor lag or independent "last N" slices cause index drift; 12 new tests, 76 total

## W0 PR 3 — terminal_state_check.py regression fix (2026-04-22)

- **fix(w0-pr3)**: Restore comprehensive `scripts/lib/terminal_state_check.py` deleted in c90615e; add `tests/test_terminal_state_check_regression.py` to prevent re-deletion (12 tests, 12 passed)

## v0.7.x — F38 Dashboard Unified (2026-04-10)

### Features
- **F38 PR-2**: Dashboard frontend — session history browser (`/operator/reports`), agent selector component, domain filter tabs (Coding/Analytics), Reports sidebar nav link, SWR hooks and types for reports and agents

## v0.6.x — F37 Auto-Report Pipeline (2026-04-08)

### Fixes
- **fix-2**: Stop hook uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for PROJECT_ROOT — eliminates symlink confusion causing assembler not to be invoked; activate F37 with `VNX_AUTO_REPORT=1` default in `vnx_paths.sh`
- **fix-3**: Heartbeat monitor skips subprocess-adapter terminals (`VNX_ADAPTER_T*=subprocess`) to prevent ghost `task_started` events and phantom leases; activate haiku classifier with `VNX_HAIKU_CLASSIFY=1` in `vnx_paths.sh`

### Features
- **F37 PR-5**: Receipt processor integration and end-to-end tests — 39 tests covering auto-generated report validation, tag flow integrity, manual report backward compatibility, subprocess trigger path, and end-to-end fixture through `ReportParser`
- **F37 PR-5**: Fix `render_markdown()` to include `**Terminal**` field required for receipt processor terminal detection

- OI-374: serve_dashboard.py decomposed into focused modules (438 + 762 + 380 lines)

## v0.5.0 — Governance Runtime Upgrade

Released: 2026-03-30

This release consolidates the largest upgrade to VNX since the initial public preview. Compared to `v0.1.0`, VNX now has a much stronger orchestration core, better recovery and worktree handling, richer intelligence and receipt pipelines, a dashboard attention model, and a significantly more mature governance surface.

Highlights:
- one-command worktree lifecycle with deterministic gates
- governance-aware finish flow and stronger pre-merge enforcement
- hardened dispatcher/tmux delivery and `vnx recover`
- intelligence export/import and self-learning feedback loop
- token/model tracking in receipts and analytics
- dashboard attention model, event timeline, and terminal health views
- Codex CLI and multi-model orchestration improvements
- configurable per-terminal models and Opus 4.6 1M default
- improved public README and documentation surface

Representative merged work since `v0.1.0`:
- dispatch lifecycle, queue, and receipt delivery hardening
- context rotation stabilization and lifecycle hooks
- lease reliability and terminal unlock behavior
- git worktree support with provenance tracking
- outbox delivery pattern and stale-pending catchup
- role-aware intelligence filtering and session analytics
- intelligence feedback loop and recommendation tracking
- dashboard attention model and operator visibility improvements
- metrics/token tracking and model detection fixes

Upgrade note:
- This is still a pre-1.0 release.
- The system is substantially beyond early preview quality, but long-running operational proving and broader adoption hardening are still ongoing.

## v0.1.0 — Public Preview

Released: 2026-02-22

Initial public preview release of VNX.
