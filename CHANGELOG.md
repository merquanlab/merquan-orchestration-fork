# Changelog

All notable changes to VNX Orchestration are documented here.

Format: [keep-a-changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [semver](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- feat(cli): `vnx version` subcommand prints VERSION, commit, VNX_HOME, pin, Python+platform (pre-central-install support)
- feat(cli): `vnx update --to <ver> --keep-last N --dry-run --rollback` subcommand for future central install version-flip (pre-central-install scaffolding)

### Fixed
- fix(cli-update): path-traversal validation + ADR-005 audit events for symlink-flip + prune + git FileNotFoundError handling (codex blocker + 3 advisories)
- fix(pyproject): build-backend `setuptools.backends._legacy` → `setuptools.build_meta`. Wheel build now succeeds via `python -m build`.

### Added
- feat(pyproject): `vnx` console_script entry-point + requires-python `>=3.11,<3.14`. Pipx-installable. (Pre-centralization must-have #6)
- feat(schema): migration 0021 `central_install_pins` + `central_install_events` tables met `scripts/lib/central_install_db.py` helper. Bookkeeping voor project pin tracking + install/update/rollback event history. Pre-centralization must-have #10.

### Changed
- chore: sync VERSION + pyproject.toml to 1.0.0-rc2 (was 1.0.0-rc1 / 0.9.0 mismatch); single-source version for pipx wheel + central install pin

### Planned (Wave 8)
- Smart provider router with task-class-aware routing (`scripts/lib/smart_router.py`)
- Unified report schema enforced via YAML frontmatter + shell-script guardrails (model-agnostic)
- Hard constraint enforcement at code level (`HardConstraintViolation` raise; T0=Opus, Kimi=CLI-only, no Anthropic SDK)
- Self-learning loop: `route_decisions_watcher.py` auto-adjusts `routing_recommendations.yaml` on production failure patterns
- Multi-project centralization via pipx wheel (D2 burn-in path: mission-control → sales-copilot → SEOcrawler)
- Module-size CI gate (prevents new 2500-LOC monoliths from landing)
- Hard-task benchmark suite (T08-T11) to discriminate Pro vs Flash on complex coding tasks

### Open horizons (post-1.0)
- Business-task benchmark suite (`scripts/benchmark_business/`) for non-coding orchestration
- Multi-operator federation with isolated state
- 100+ concurrent dispatch scale tuning

## [1.0.0-rc1+wave7] - 2026-05-17

- **dispatcher (#502)** — log stderr, fix `script_dir` leak, receipt processor bootstrap-mode
- **ADR-003 (#505)** — clarify API-key + CLI permitted; SDK still banned

### Added — CONTRIBUTING (#489)

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` + CI lint gate enforcing atomic-write and silent-except policies

## [1.0.0-rc1] - 2026-05-09

Architectural stabilization milestone. 14 ADRs locked. Central VNX state proven on real production data (855k snippets across 4 projects, 0 verifier discrepancies). CI gate enforces OAuth-only Claude routing. Smart context injection validated at +30 percentage-point dispatch quality lift on 658 outcome-tagged dispatches.

From this release forward, dispatch envelope, receipt schema, NDJSON ledger format, and ADR-locked invariants are backwards-compatibility-honoring.

### Added — ADR backfill (10 new ADRs, 003-014)

- ADR-003 OAuth-only Claude routing via `claude -p` subprocess (no SDK, no API key)
- ADR-004 VNX positioning: self-hosted alternative to Anthropic Managed Agents
- ADR-005 Append-only NDJSON audit ledger as primary orchestration substrate
- ADR-006 Mandatory staging→promote with human approval gate
- ADR-007 Multi-tenant `project_id` stamping with composite UNIQUE rebuilds
- ADR-008 Dual-LLM adversarial review (codex_gate + gemini_review) with `contract_hash` evidence binding
- ADR-009 Schema-first migrations via PRAGMA introspection
- ADR-010 Subprocess adapter (`claude -p`) as canonical Claude routing
- ADR-011 Manager+worker hierarchy with explicit depth>1
- ADR-012 Hybrid interactive+headless (no retire-interactive)
- ADR-013 Worker pool size as configuration (workers = N)
- ADR-014 Autonomous mode = pre-approved chain dispatch with SHA-256 chain-spec hash as consent token

### Added — Structural enforcement

- CI gate `ADR-003: No Anthropic SDK Imports` blocks any `import anthropic` / `from anthropic` / `import claude_agent_sdk` in `scripts/`, `dashboard/`, `tests/`

### Added — Wave 1 shadow-mode read cutover (PR #450-#454)

- `shadow_verifier.py` — independent comparator with 6 zero-tolerance divergence metrics
- `shadow_logger.py` NDJSON writer + CLI + flock-rotation
- T0 state-builder + IntelligenceSelector + DispatchRegister + Dashboard shadow wiring across 13 read sites
- Canary divergence test pack (14+ fixtures) + operator-readable rollback procedure

### Added — Wave 5 smart-context injection (PR #455-#461)

- Prior-round-findings injection (W5.0)
- ADR injection by file-touch (W5.1)
- Code anchor injection (W5.2)
- Operator memory injection (W5.3)
- Schema introspection injection (W5.4)
- Production plumbing for P0-P4 context-bundle classes (W5.5)

### Added — Wave 4 OTel observability foundation (PR #468)

- Opt-in OpenTelemetry export wired into `subprocess_dispatch` completion. Emits `dispatch_completion_count` metric + spans. Env-gated via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`; no-op when unset.

### Added — Wave 4.5 provider parity (PR #471, #472, #477, #479)

- `PromptAssembler` provider-agnostic methods (claude/codex/gemini/litellm)
- Codex + Gemini adapters use `PromptAssembler`; `AGENTS.md` + `GEMINI.md` tri-file activated by `vnx init` bootstrap
- Gate reviewer prompts use `gh pr diff` authoritative source
- Intelligence injection per-provider with empty-`dispatch_id` guard (audit-safe)

### Added — Wave 2 package extraction foundation (PR #469, #478)

- `pyproject.toml` + `vnx_core` + `vnx_cli` package skeleton with smoke tests
- First module migration: `function_size_gate.py` → `vnx_core` with `sys.path`-fallback shim

### Fixed — OI-1370 systemic locking refactor (PR #482-#486)

- Original `migrate_phase3_envelope` race (writer pre-rename appends to unlinked inode) required system-wide locking refactor across all writer paths
- `scripts/lib/state_writer.append_locked()` helper with sentinel registry; 100-thread × 100-write concurrency test passes
- 4-PR migration of all envelope/state writers to helper
- All four implementation PRs (#483-#486) implemented by **Codex CLI workers** — first production codex-worker dispatches in this codebase

### Fixed — Security + governance

- **OI-1369 (#465)** Path traversal in `vnx_paths.resolve_central_data_dir` — strict regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,31}$`
- **OI-1294 (#467)** `compact_open_items_digest` function-size 76→34 via mechanical helper extraction
- **OI-1415 (#462)** `review_contract.content_hash` backward-compat for empty `deleted_files`

### Added — Repo hygiene (OI-1373 cleanup)

- 5-tier OI-1373 cleanup: 49 strategic/business docs moved from public `roadmap/`+`docs/internal/` to gitignored `claudedocs/`
- Pattern: filesystem `mv` + `git add -u` (NOT `git mv`) — preserves files locally on disk while removing from git tracking

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-30

Chain summary: 27 PRs landed across governance hardening, headless audit parity, supervisor pack, CFX thematic refactors, P0 intelligence loop fixes.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-11

Streaming + autonomous loop + A/B test milestone.

### Added

- **F42 PR-1** Restore EventStore from git history + dashboard archive endpoints for historical dispatch event retrieval
